            In 2020, the news website ZEIT ONLINE replaced its Drupal-based
            comments database with a lightweight, flexible and scalable system
            that stores more than 10.000 new comments a day.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As a product owner, I and my colleague Thomas Strotjohann set up an
            agile development process and defined the new databaseâ€™s qualities
            in user stories.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The challenge was to exchange databases during live operations.
            Working in the invisible and reconnecting a service deeply
            intertwined within the basic functioning of the news web page was an
            inspiring challenge.

          <p className="mb-4">
            The comment sections of articles are an essential feature of the
            online news media. They allow readers to exchange ideas, engage in
            discussions and react to what is going on in the world. To help the
            professional moderators to do their job and keep comment sections a
            safe space, a new tool was needed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In this project, I took the role of a product owner together with
            the former head of product at ZEIT ONLINE. We aimed at building a
            tool that provides a seamless moderation experience. By continous
            user testing, we were able to give shape to the tool while actually
            building it.
