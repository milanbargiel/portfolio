          In 2020, the news website ZEIT ONLINE replaced its Drupal-based
          comments database with a lightweight, flexible and scalable system
          that stores more than 10.000 new comments each day. As a product
          owner, I was part of the team that set up an agile development process
          and defined the new databaseâ€™s qualities in user stories. Thanks to a
          sophisticated sync between the old and the new database we were able
          to switch systems without hardly anyone noticing.

          Comment sections are an essential feature of the online news media
          ZEIT ONLINE. They allow readers to exchange ideas, engage in
          discussions and react to stories. To help the team of professional
          moderators to do their job and keep comment sections a safe space, a
          new tool was needed that reduced the complexity of former workflows.
          In this project I took the role of a product owner. A high-fidelity
          prototype helped us to test our assumptions before actually
          implementing the solution.
