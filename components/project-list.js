            . They allow people to exchange ideas, engage in discussions and
            express their thoughts about what is going on in the world.

          <p className="mb-4">
            To keep comment sections a safe space, the professional team of
            moderators at ZEIT ONLINE needed a new tool that reduced the
            complexity of former workflows and provides a seamless moderation
            experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In this project, I took the role of a product owner together with
            the former head of product at ZEIT ONLINE. By conducting workshops
            with moderators, prototyping and continuous user testing, we were
            able to give shape to the tool while actually building it.

          <p className="mb-4">
            In 2020, the news website ZEIT ONLINE replaced its comments database
            with a lightweight, flexible and scalable system that stores more
            than 10.000 new comments a day.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As a product owner, I and my colleague Thomas Strotjohann set up an
            agile development process and defined the databaseâ€™s qualities in
            user stories.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The challenge was to exchange databases during live operations.
            Working in the invisible and reconnecting a service deeply
            intertwined with the basic functioning of the news web page was an
            inspiring challenge.
