        In 2020, the news website ZEIT ONLINE replaced its Drupal-based comments
        database with a lightweight, flexible and scalable system that stores
        more than 10.000 new comments each day. As a product owner, I set up an
        agile development process and defined the new databaseâ€™s qualities in
        user stories.

        Comment sections are an essential feature of the online news media ZEIT
        ONLINE. They allow readers to exchange ideas, engage in discussions and
        react to stories. To help the team of professional moderators to do
        their job and keep comment sections a safe space, a new tool was needed
        that reduced the complexity of former workflows. In this project I took
        the role of a product owner.
